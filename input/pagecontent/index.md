### Introduction
“Eyes on FHIR ®” background and introduction Heading

#### Purpose 
Despite FHIR's® popularity and maturity accelerating as a community driven and implementer-focused modern flagship of healthcare standards to support interoperable healthcare data exchange, its application to medical specialties such as ophthalmology remains limited. 

This is due to a core problem – there is no universal implementation guidance (IG), which is required to enable truly systemic interoperability that holds promise to advance clinical care and catalyze biomedical research.
Hence, "Eyes on FHIR" initiative was formed with the overarching mission to develop the  international standards that can enable FHIR ® to enhance the quality and outcomes of ophthalmic healthcare delivery. 

To do this, "Eyes on FHIR" aims to represent the comprehensive ophthalmic clinical lexicon in FHIR ® format and through a series of compiled real world use cases, develop this IG to address the data exchange problems through semantically interoperable .

A notable achievement was demonstrated in [May ‘21 connectathon](Eyes on FHIR ophthalmology track connectathon 27May2021.pdf), which showcased bidirectional real-time data exchange between various real world electronic medical record (EHR) vendors and fundamental ophthalmic diagnostic device and PACS manufacturers. This was a world first proof of concept, strongly endorsed by the NIH - please see the output connectathon report here for more details (link to PDF report)
As a multimodal imaging-dependant specialty, there have already been significant artificial intelligence (AI) publications and implementations for automating the diagnosis and triaging of eye disease. A few cardinal publications are referenced here:

In addition to the outlined use cases, please see a proposed diagram [here](https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=104565555) for how FHIR and DICOM compliment the workflow’s of clinical and imaging data respectively to optimally enable AI deployment.
