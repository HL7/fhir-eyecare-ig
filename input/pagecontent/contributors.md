To date, this endeavor’s achievements are owing to the commitment of an exclusively community-based, volunteer-driven collaboration of key ophthalmic and technical stakeholders. A large thanks to:

### Research Institutions 
The following research institutions have provided foundational support and endorsement

Additionally, many major peak ophthalmic medical bodies across the globe have informally endorsed this endeavor, but timeliness has prevented official board publication. Deepening engagement here is a priority for the next ballot cycle.


### Industry Vendors
The following industry vendors have been integral to compilation of this implementation guide and its overarching goals through collaborative use case development, testing and validation of IG integrity at May ‘21 HL7 FHIR connectathon and subsequent plans for real world pilot implementation in clinical settings:

**Diagnostic Device Manufacturers**

### Specific Terminology Advisory
In addition to HL7 and the extended community, we’d like to acknowledge the input of the following standards and informatics bodies upon whose input and long standing iterative curation of developing medical terminologies was drawn indispensably.
* DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) community
* SNOMED CT - a non-hierarchical codified language that represents groups of clinical terms; it has international applicability and regionally relevant adaptations 
* LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) - open sourced database of terminologies that codifies laboratory and clinical observations
* ICD (International Classification of Diseases) - a World Health Organisation diagnostic classification system
* CPT © (Current Procedural Terminology) - The AMA (American Medical Association’s database of codes used to describe medical, surgical, and diagnostic services and is designed to communicate uniform information about medical services and procedures among physicians, coders, patients, accreditation organizations, and payers for administrative, financial, and analytical purposes
* The American Academy of Ophthalmology’s Medical Informatics and Technology Committee (chaired by Thomas Hwang, MD)
